<h2>I Know Nothing about Quadcopters</h2>
<p>This project started my freshman year when I proposed to build a drone for my embedded systems final project. The professor quickly shut that idea down because it was &quot;over-ambitious&quot; but I pursued the project on my own anyways. So here we are!</p>
<h2>The Frame</h2>
<p>I learned to CAD through this project. I used <a href="https://www.shapr3d.com/">Shapr3D</a> and the <a href="https://www.prusa3d.com/category/original-prusa-i3-mk3s/">Prusa i3 Mk3</a> to build the frame of the drone.</p>
<h2>Electronics</h2>
<p>Powering four motors seemed pretty straight forward, but I had a lot to learn in doing this efficiently and without risking other parts of my circuit. So at a glance I&#39;m using a MOSFET for each motor with its gate connected to a PWM pin on the microcontroller. And for that I&#39;m using the <a href="https://www.seeedstudio.com/XIAO-RP2040-v1-0-p-5026.html">XIAO RP2040</a> due to its convenient form factor.</p>
<p>The on-board sensor is the <a href="https://invensense.tdk.com/products/motion-tracking/6-axis/mpu-6050/">MPU6050</a> which is quite dated but its <a href="https://mjwhite8119.github.io/Robots/mpu6050">Digital Motion Processor (DMP)</a> gives good-enough results.</p>
<p>The motors and battery all operate at 3.7V.</p>
<h2>R.I.P.</h2>
<p>Again, I made this freshman year. So my only option for making things &quot;permanent&quot; was through a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfboard">perfboard</a> which is generally a bad idea for this scale of a circuit. Nevertheless, it worked and I was able to operate and modulate the speed of each motor one/all at a time. But the first test flight (when I was still writing the flight controller) crashed and smushed all electronic components sticking out... then every subsequent test short-circuited the battery and started smoking.</p>
<h2>The Future..?</h2>
<p>Two years later, I&#39;m taking How to Make Almost Anything and it so happens that we&#39;ll be learning PCB design. So I&#39;ll be making v2 of this project and updating progress at <a href="https://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.23/EECS/people/Yohan/">my blog there</a> first!</p>
