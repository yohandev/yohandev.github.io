This project is from a few years back when I'd make Minecraft plugins for servers my friends and I played on. I made many such plugins but I'm most proud of this one. It brings a lot of elements from RPGs and *The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild* to Minecraft.

Notably, I modified world generation to include dungeon waypoints (e.g. the sword in the video above) and other world structures. Implemented is also a cinematic cut-scene system with keyframes and support for random variations (the world is randomly generated so no two cut-scenes will ever be the same nor can they be exactly predetermined). This is written in **Java** but (if I remember correctly) it was eventually ported to **Kotlin**!
