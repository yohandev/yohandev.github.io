<p>This project is from a few years back when I&#39;d make Minecraft plugins for servers my friends and I played on. I made many such plugins but I&#39;m most proud of this one. It brings a lot of elements from RPGs and <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> to Minecraft.</p>
<p>Notably, I modified world generation to include dungeon waypoints (e.g. the sword in the video above) and other world structures. Implemented is also a cinematic cut-scene system with keyframes and support for random variations (the world is randomly generated so no two cut-scenes will ever be the same nor can they be exactly predetermined). This is written in <strong>Java</strong> but (if I remember correctly) it was eventually ported to <strong>Kotlin</strong>!</p>
