As a kid, I loved *Star Wars: Battlefront* and especially its spaceship game mode. The issue is many of my friends didn't own the game (or a PS4 altogether) so I made a replica of the game in **Unity3D**. It's entirely multiplayer (peer to peer) and features a randomly generated map, turret AIs and aim-assist.
