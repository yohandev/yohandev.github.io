I learned to code through [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) and felt like the jump between that and "actual" programming was a little much for elementary schoolers. So, this project aims to teach kids important programming concepts (encapsulation, inheritance, etc.) while maintaining the familiar block interface.

This isn't a modification of the original; it's made completely from scratch (lol). The interface is a combination of vanilla **Javascript** and SVG elements. I made this in a few days for a hackathon an it won an *honorary mention*.
