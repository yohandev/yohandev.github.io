<p>I learned to code through <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a> and felt like the jump between that and &quot;actual&quot; programming was a little much for elementary schoolers. So, this project aims to teach kids important programming concepts (encapsulation, inheritance, etc.) while maintaining the familiar block interface.</p>
<p>This isn&#39;t a modification of the original; it&#39;s made completely from scratch (lol). The interface is a combination of vanilla <strong>Javascript</strong> and SVG elements. I made this in a few days for a hackathon an it won an <em>honorary mention</em>.</p>
